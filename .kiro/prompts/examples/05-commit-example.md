## 📋 Agent Workflow (commit.prompt.md v2.0)

### Phase 1: Smart Change Analysis ⭐ MANDATORY

**Agent analyzes git changes:**

```bash
git status
git diff --cached
```

**Output:**

```
On branch feature/product-reviews
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   lib/features/reviews/data/models/review_model.dart
        new file:   test/unit/review_model_test.dart
```

**Agent categorizes changes:**

```
📊 Change Analysis

Source Code Changes:
✅ lib/features/reviews/data/models/review_model.dart (NEW)
   - ReviewModel class with @collection
   - Fields: id, productId, customerId, rating, text, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Indexes: productId, customerId, rating
   - Composite index for uniqueness
   - 85 lines

Test Changes:
✅ test/unit/review_model_test.dart (NEW)
   - 4 test cases
   - Tests model creation
   - Tests index queries
   - Tests uniqueness constraint
   - 120 lines

Configuration Changes:
❌ None

Documentation Changes:
❌ None

Artifacts to Filter:
❌ None (no generated files, build outputs, or IDE configs)
```

---

### Phase 2: Automatic Artifact Filtering ⭐

**Agent filters out:**

```
🔍 Artifact Filtering

Checking for common artifacts:
❌ *.g.dart files - None found
❌ *.freezed.dart files - None found
❌ build/ directory - Not in commit
❌ .dart_tool/ - Not in commit
❌ *.iml files - Not in commit
❌ .idea/ - Not in commit

✅ All changes are meaningful source code
✅ No artifacts to filter
```

---

### Phase 3: Commit Type Determination

**Agent determines:**

```
📝 Commit Type Analysis

Change Type: NEW FEATURE
Scope: reviews (data layer)
Breaking Change: No

Reasoning:
- New functionality added (review model)
- Part of reviews feature
- No existing code modified
- No breaking changes

Conventional Commit Type: feat
```

---

### Phase 4: Message Generation

**Agent generates:**

```markdown
# Commit Message (Draft)
